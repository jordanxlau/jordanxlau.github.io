                <h2>All about Me</h2>
                <p>I'm currently in my third year of university, specializing in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa with a minor in Linguistics. I am a Dean's Honour List student. I consider myself a well-rounded student, but I'm especially strong in math, computer science, and French. I've tutored for over 3 years and tutored everything from 2nd-grade French Immersion to Calculus and Vectors. I consider myself an excellent tutor because I am patient and can adapt my sessions to every tutee's individual needs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>My interests include swimming, films, and languages. In high school, I was actively involved in swim teams, and drama productions. Actually, I still swim - with the uOttawa Triathlon club! I'm certified in  the Principles of Healthy Child Development. I am also proud to have been awarded twice the Merit Award Bursary and Canadian Hearing Services National Scholarship. I have always been an avid learner, so I now enjoy sharing my knowledge with younger students to help them succeed as well.</div>

                    <p>In Jordan, I not only found an exceptional tutor but also a role model and mentor for my son. I saw continual improvement of my son's command of the subjects, and grades. I would highly recommend Jordan not only for his academic knowledge, but his teaching style, which delivers results.</p>
